\title{Evaluates power functions for power.prop.test}
\usage{
calc_prop(n, theta, xi, alpha, save_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{numeric vector containing possible range of sample sizes}

\item{theta}{numeric vector containing possible range of effect sizes}

\item{xi}{numeric vector containing possible range of proportions}

\item{alpha}{numeric vector containing possible range of significance levels}
}
\value{
list of calculated powCalc objects
}
\description{
For all pre-set combinations of n, theta, xi and alpha, this function calculates a list of powCalc
objects and saves.
}
