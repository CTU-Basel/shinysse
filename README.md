# shinysse
'shinysse' is an R package containing a modular shiny app that demonstrates sample size estimation.

This app is a work in-progress and is currently not validated. Furthermore, it is for demonstration purposes only by design, and cannot replace a well crafted statistical modelling performed by a skilled statistician.

shinysse is based on [thofab's 'sse' package](https://github.com/thofab/sse).
